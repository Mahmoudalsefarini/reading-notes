that specify its size:


- height
This specifies the height of the
image in pixels.


* width

image in pixels.

1: 'before a paragraph
The paragraph starts on a new
line after the image.'


2: 'inside the start of a
paragraph
The first row of text aligns with
the bottom of the image.'


3: 'in the middle of a
paragraph
The image is placed between the
words of the paragraph that it
appears in.'
