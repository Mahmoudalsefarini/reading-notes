# HTML Lists, Control Flow with JS, and the CSS Box Model

# Lists

* There are lots of occasions when we
need to use lists. HTML provides us with
three different types:
1-  Ordered lists are lists where each item in the list is
numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for
a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract
where each point needs to be identified by a section number.

2-  Unordered lists are lists that begin with a bullet point
(rather than characters that indicate order).

3-  Definition lists are made up of a set of terms along with the
definitions for each of those terms .

# Boxes

* At the beginning of this section on CSS,
you saw how CSS treats each HTML
element as if it lives in its own box.

* You can set several properties that affect the appearance of these boxes. In this chapter you will see how to:
1- Control the dimensions of your boxes
2- Create borders around boxes
3- Set margins and padding for boxes
4- Show and hide boxes

* Once you have learned how to control the appearance of each
box, you will see how to position these boxes on your pages in
Chapter 15 when we look at page layout.
