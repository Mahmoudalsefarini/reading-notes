# UNDERSTANDING ERRORS

* If a JavaScript statement generates an error, then it throws an exception.
At that point, the interpreter stops and looks for exception-handling code.

# ERROR OBJECTS CONTINUED

* Syntax Error / SYNTAX IS NOT CORRECT

* Ref erenceError / VARIABLE DOES NOT EXIST

* EvalError / INCORRECT USE OF eval() FUNCTION

* URI Error / INCORRECT USE OF URI FUNCTIONS
* Type Error / VALUE IS UNEXPECTED DATA TYPE
* RangeError / NUMBER OUTSIDE OF RANGE
* Error / GENERIC ERROR OBJECT
* NaN / NOT AN ERROR / NOT A NUMBER


# BREAKPOINTS

* You can pause the execution of a script on any
line using breakpoints. Then you can check the
va lues stored in variables at that point in time.

# DEBUGGING TIPS
* ANOTHER BROWSER
* ADD NUMBERS
* STRIP IT BACK
* EXPLAINING THE CODE
* SEARCH
* CODE PLAYGROUNDS
