* Links are the defining feature of the web
because they allow you to move from
one web page to another â€” enabling the
very idea of browsing or surfing.
You will commonly come across the following types of links:

1- Links from one website to another
2- Links from one page to another on the same website
3- Links from one part of a web page to another part of the
same page
4- Links that open in a new browser window
5- Links that start up your email program and address a new
email to someone
